# FourierFun
Just a simple plotting script to demonstrate how periodic functions can be broken down into waves of varying frequencies.

In `square_wave_fourier_series.py`, I plot what happens when you add together higher and higher frequency sine waves (odd harmonics of the fundamental frequency).  One sees that as the maximum frequency component increases, the summed waveform begins to closely approximate a square wave.

I generated an animated gif using ImageMagick's `convert` command line utlity to visualize what happens as the maximum frequency component increases.
